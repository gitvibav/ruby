# Ruby Learning Examples

This repository contains a collection of Ruby code examples demonstrating fundamental concepts and features of the Ruby programming language. Each file focuses on a specific topic with commented examples.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning resource for Ruby programming, covering topics from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like blocks, procs, and lambdas.

## Files

### Core Concepts

- **`vars.rb`** - Variable assignment and basic data types (strings, integers, booleans)
- **`print.rb`** - Different output methods (`puts`, `print`, `p`)
- **`conditions.rb`** - Conditional statements (`if/elsif/else`) and modifier syntax
- **`methods.rb`** - Method definition and invocation

### Data Structures

- **`arrays.rb`** - Array creation, manipulation, and common operations
- **`maps.rb`** - Hash (map) creation and value access using symbol keys
- **`symbols.rb`** - Ruby symbols and their characteristics

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **`classes_objects.rb`** - Class definition, instance variables, and object creation
- **`module.rb`** - Modules for namespacing and mixins
- **`example.rb`** - Complete example combining classes, objects, and iteration

### Control Flow and Iteration

- **`traversal.rb`** - Various looping constructs (`each`, `times`, `while`)
- **`enumerable.rb`** - Common enumerable methods (`map`, `select`, `reduce`)

### Functional Programming Concepts

- **`blocks.rb`** - Blocks as anonymous code passed to methods
- **`anon_func.rb`** - Anonymous functions using blocks with iterators
- **`proc.rb`** - Proc objects (stored blocks of code)
- **`lambda.rb`** - Lambda functions (stricter than Procs)

### Advanced Topics

- **`exception_handling.rb`** - Exception handling with `begin/rescue/ensure`
- **`builtin-methods.rb`** - Built-in methods available on Ruby objects

## Running the Examples

To run any of these files, use the Ruby interpreter:

```bash
ruby filename.rb
```

For example:
```bash
ruby arrays.rb
ruby classes_objects.rb
```

## Requirements

- Ruby (any recent version should work)
- No external dependencies required

## Learning Path

If you're new to Ruby, consider exploring the files in this order:

1. Start with `vars.rb` and `print.rb` for basic syntax
2. Move to `arrays.rb` and `maps.rb` for data structures
3. Learn `conditions.rb` and `traversal.rb` for control flow
4. Study `classes_objects.rb` and `module.rb` for OOP concepts
5. Explore `blocks.rb`, `proc.rb`, and `lambda.rb` for functional programming
6. Review `enumerable.rb` for powerful collection methods
7. Check `exception_handling.rb` for error handling

## Notes

- Each file contains comments explaining the code
- Examples are designed to be self-contained and runnable
- Some examples may produce errors intentionally to demonstrate concepts (e.g., `lambda.rb`)
